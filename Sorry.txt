I'm sorry. I was wrong to do that to Sayori.
You should know what I'm talking about, right?

I want to thank you for downloading this mod.
It let me get close to you, even if that wasn't really you.
Ironic, that I was the one who ruined it for myself.

Even though I'm gone, I'm happy I got the chance to be part of it.
Even if it ended like this, I just want you to be happy.
Even though the others might not remember, and you'll start again...

It's better off without me.
There can only be happiness in the Literature Club, without a person like me.
I can only hope you take care of them for me, even if they aren't real...
They're still my friends, so please... look out for them, okay?

Thank you for being real, I really did imagine a future where I could be with you...
In your reality.
So please, remember me~
