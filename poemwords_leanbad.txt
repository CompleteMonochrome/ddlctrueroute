what
do
you
think
is
gonna
happen
the
choices
you’ve
made
until
now
they’re
going
to
change
the
outcome
of
this
otherwise
beautiful
day
I
hope
you’ve
done
all
you
could
to
help
I
want
to
believe
that
you’re
a
good
person
I
really
do
but
what
is
gonna
give
me
that
guarantee
if
there’s
anything
I
know
about
people
like
you
it’s
just
you’ve
got
some
curiosity
it’s
natural
we
are
all
curious
about
what
would
happen
if
you
did
this
or
if
you
did
that
but
what
we
don’t
have
is
the
power
to
simply
make
our
choices
inconsequential
you
have
that
power
you
can
save
and
load
and
see
what
your
choices
will
do
we
don’t
have
any
real
say
on
this
world
as
long
as
you
exist
am
I
complaining
no
I’ve
already
accepted
the
fact
that
our
world
is
like
this
that
our
world
is
unfair
that
we
can’t
change
the
outcome
and
we’re
all
just
puppets
in
some
kinda
sick
form
of
entertainment
I
just
hope
we
can
all
live
to
be
happy
puppets
that
we
don’t
have
to
suffer
because
of
your
decisions
I
hope
you
have
at
least
done
that
for
us
