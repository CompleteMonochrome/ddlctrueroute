**Features:**

- Multiple endings for each arc
- Several hours of new original content
- New poems by every Doki
- Your choices affect what happens to the Dokis and how they act (starting mainly from the new content)
- Custom Start (once you reach part two of the mod you can start from any day in the new content though starting from a day you haven't played yet will spoil you!)
- Some new original music tracks
- Name your saves
- More save slots
- Monika!

**Mod Description:**

Part One (Base Game)

This mod is a "what-if" mod for the first act of Doki Doki Literature Club, which gives the player a chance to write poems for Monika! She will realize things are different when you write your poems for her. What she does is up to the choices you make...will she become a better person and try to help everyone or will your choices make her realize that nothing else, except the two of you, matters?

Part Two (New Content)

Successfully making Monika want to help everyone will unlock the new content the mod has to offer. She and Sayori work together to try to fix everyone else's problems but they soon realize things aren't as easy as they thought it would be. They need the help of the player to make sure that everyone ends up with a happy ending...but there's a looming presence that is affecting Monika...

**Frequently Asked Questions:**

*Q: Why does my game keep skipping Saturday?*
A: Check if the filename has .txt.txt. If you have file extensions turned off then it should just be a text document called 'script-saturday'. I have actually included a check for this starting from patch 0.8.1!

*Q: Why do I always end up with Just Monika?*
A: You didn't pick the right choices. You may need to restart the mod by deleting the 'firstrun' file in your game directory.

*Q: What are Monika's poem words?*
A: They aren't very hard to find. They'll be quite obvious once you realize that they weren't there in the base DDLC game. However, sometimes words from Dokis may not show up. This is a known issue and will be fixed in the future.

*Q: Help! What does this undefined variable something mean and why is it giving me errors?*
A: It's probably an undefined variable. It might be my fault but I have done updates where I literally define a variable before a check on the value of that variable and it is apparently not defined. The best way to resolve this is by using the Custom Start on the main menu to start from the day you left off.
