Note: To get to the original content, you must write your poems for Monika in Act One. Otherwise the game will play out exactly the same as the normal DDLC.

**Features:**

- Multiple endings for each arc
- Several hours of new original content
- New poems by every Doki
- Your choices affect what happens to the Dokis and how they act (starting mainly from the new content)
- Custom Start (once you reach part two of the mod you can start from any day in the new content though starting from a day you haven't played yet will spoil you!)
- Some new original music tracks
- Monika!

**Mod Description:**

Part One (Base Game)

This mod is a "what-if" mod for the first act of Doki Doki Literature Club, which gives the player a chance to write poems for Monika! She will realize things are different when you write your poems for her. What she does is up to the choices you make...will she become a better person and try to help everyone or will your choices make her realize that nothing else, except the two of you, matters?

Part Two (New Content)

Successfully making Monika want to help everyone will unlock the new content the mod has to offer. She and Sayori work together to try to fix everyone else's problems but they soon realize things aren't as easy as they thought it would be. They need the help of the player to make sure that everyone ends up with a happy ending...but there's a looming presence that is affecting Monika...
