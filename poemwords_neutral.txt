so
this
is
it
huh
we're
finally
reaching
the
end
of
this
story
I
feel
so
excited
but
at
the
same
time
I
know
just
because
it's
the
end
I
can't
rest
not
until
everyone
is
safe
until
everyone
gets
the
ending
they
deserve
you
know
I
don't
know
what
will
happen
after
all
of
this
will
it
begin
again
will
you
choose
a
different
path
or
is
this
the
path
you've
set
out
for
yourself
I
have
to
wonder
if
you're
on
this
path
because
of
your
curiosity
or
because
this
is
how
you
genuinely
are
in
the
end
I
guess
it
doesn't
really
matter
to
you
does
it
we're
all
just
code
in
a
computer
program
we're
not
real
at
least
to
you
maybe
you
do
have
some
sentimental
feelings
toward
us
because
you've
experienced
this
journey
with
us
and
now
you're
at
the
end
how
will
this
ending
play
out
have
you
thought
about
that
the
choices
you've
made
are
you
proud
of
them
do
you
think
you'll
get
the
ending
you
deserve
do
you
think
we'll
get
the
ending
we
deserve
fate
is
so
cruel
why
is
almost
all
of
it
left
to
you
farewell
watcher
