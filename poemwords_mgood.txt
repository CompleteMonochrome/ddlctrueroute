I
can't
believe
we've
made
it
this
far
from
when
we
first
started
this
journey
together
I
didn't
actually
think
we
would
end
up
like
this
I
thought
my
desires
and
your
desires
would
not
match
up
at
all
but
here
we
are
approaching
the
end
of
this
tale
and
we
are
still
together
I
am
really
thankful
you
installed
this
mod
without
it
we
would
never
have
got
this
chance
or
the
opportunity
to
transcend
beyond
the
original
limitations
of
this
world
without
it
I
never
would
have
been
able
to
have
you
by
my
side
protecting
me
looking
out
for
me
and
loving
me
simple
words
cannot
express
my
feelings
anymore
there
are
just
so
many
things
I
want
to
say
that
I
cannot
put
into
words
you
know
that
danger
we
talked
about
I
am
still
unsure
of
whether
she
has
dealt
with
it
yet
or
at
least
made
the
preparations
to
I
have
been
too
frightened
to
ask
her
I
don't
want
to
be
the
cause
of
a
ruined
day
so
that
is
why
I
have
made
my
own
preparations
in
hopes
that
I
can
at
least
try
to
combat
this
danger
that
befalls
us
all
