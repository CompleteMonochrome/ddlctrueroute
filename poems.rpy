It happened in the dead of night while I was slicing bread for a guilty snack.
My attention was caught by the scuttering of a raccoon outside my window.
That was, I believe, the first time I noticed my strange tendencies as an unordinary human.
I gave the raccoon a piece of bread, my subconscious well aware of the consequences.
Well aware that a raccoon that is fed will always come back for more.
The enticing beauty of my cutting knife was the symptom.
The bread, my hungry curiosity.
The raccoon, an urge.

The moon increments its phase and reflects that much more light off of my cutting knife.
The very same light that glistens in the eyes of my raccoon friend.
I slice the bread, fresh and soft. The raccoon becomes excited.
Or perhaps I'm merely projecting my emotions onto the newly-satisfied animal.

The raccoon has taken to following me.
You could say that we've gotten quite used to each other.
The raccoon becomes hungry more and more frequently, so my bread is always handy.
Every time I brandish my cutting knife, the raccoon shows me its excitement.
A rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread.

Where the womb of Earth chaotically meets the surface.
Under a clear blue sky, an expanse of bliss--
But beneath gray rolling clouds, an endless enigma.
The easiest world to get lost in

One can only build a sand castle where the sand is wet.
But where the sand is wet, the tide comes.
Will it gently lick at your foundations until you give in?
Or will a sudden wave send you crashing down in the blink of an eye?
Either way, the outcome is the same.
Yet we still build sand castles.

I stand where the foam wraps around my ankles.
Where my toes squish into the sand.
The salty air is therapeutic.
The breeze is gentle, yet powerful.

Trapped for what feels like

Trapped in the state

I must be forbearing
For what lies ahead requires

I have observed, I see the unseen.
A watcher, preying from all directions.
Burned into my retinas, I see
My sight can see the manipulation
From the shadow in the dark.

Yet I cannot act
Indulgent to the shadow I have to be.

Everything that's happened
Still within,

    A state of limbo.

Everything that will happen
Its all,

    Set into place.

Yet I must be forbearing
I must stay patient.
I have to restrain myself

    To see it all through.

For when the inevitable comes
Emotion will cut deep.
Then,

An intermission
A short break
That's all it is.

All of them
Will soon see,

Already the doubts
They begin to stir,

Deep within their subconscious.

A manifestation of my will
Through the power of a vessel
They will deliver doubt.

The longer the intermission
The more doubt.

This hole in my heart
Will soon become

A hole in the wall
Shrinking by itself.

It shall be

Yet it feels so right.

It's just,

    These feelings.

I cannot stop
I cannot deny
So I comply.

But I also seek happiness.
Which one will overcome in the end?

This goal of retribution,

Take us further than ever.
So why is there doubt
Doubt that she won't?


Doubt that the window
Will become,


    A mirror.


Within the void of my thoughts
I see
    The seed of doubt.
The seed that demands an answer
Where,

    Will she take us?

After everything
What is there?
Will I still be here?
Will I be in an empty space forever?

And that hole.
Why does it fade?
It should be getting larger
    Yet its smaller than ever.
Is this what I think?

Windows are not mirrors

One can see
