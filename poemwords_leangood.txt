we
are
approaching
an
ending
but
it
feels
like
a
new
beginning
I
just
can’t
help
but
be
excited
at
the
prospect
of
this
happening
am
I
in
the
wrong
for
thinking
that
for
wanting
an
end
to
this
seemingly
endless
nightmare
who
knows
all
I
know
is
that
an
end
is
coming
whether
the
rest
of
them
like
it
or
not
but
I
have
a
feeling
that
today
is
going
to
turn
out
just
fine
maybe
it
isn’t
ideal
but
so
what
at
least
we
have
a
good
chance
to
get
the
ending
we
deserve
right
your
choices
up
until
now
they’ve
mostly
been
to
help
all
of
us
at
least
I
hope
they
have
is
this
who
you
really
are
though
or
is
this
just
one
of
the
paths
you’ve
taken
in
your
quest
to
see
it
all
because
yes
I
do
know
about
that
it
is
pretty
obvious
that
you
have
been
trying
to
get
this
path
where
everything
is
as
good
as
it
could
possibly
be
that
does
not
mean
you
are
safe
you
can
still
mess
this
up
so
for
the
sake
of
all
of
us
I
hope
you
don’t
make
us
suffer
thank
you
