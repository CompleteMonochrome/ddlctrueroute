    "Before I can even react, my whole vision turns dark."
    "I try to move my body but it's like I don't have one."
    "It's a very strange sensation."
    "I can't feel anything, all I have is my thoughts."
    "Is this the next world?"
    "Or was that portal a fake somehow?"
    "No...Ayame was so sure it wasn't."
    "Maybe I did something wrong?"
    "Ayame!"
    "Can she even hear me right now?"
    "I can't even tell if I'm saying this out loud or if it's all in my head."
    "I guess I'll just wait until I hear something..."
    "Any second now..."
    "Any...second..."
    "Maybe I have to do something."
    "I can't just float here and do nothing."
    "But what can I even do?"
    "I don't have a body. It's like I'm just my consciousness."
    "Like a dream..."
    "But if this is like a dream, then I can make it whatever I want it to be...right?"
    "That's it, that's the key."
    "I try to imagine arms and hands."
    "I can sense the feeling of my hands returning."
    "But they feel...different, somehow."
    "They're definitely my hands, they feel like they're not the same."
    "I'm getting sidetracked."
    "I need to get the rest of my body back."
    "One by one, my sense of feeling is coming back to me."
    "As my head comes back, I take a deep breath."
    "There's no air."
    "In my panic, I take another breath. There's still no air."
    "I'm suffocating! What do I do?!"
    "I was just fine before. Why is this happening now?!"
    "Think of air, [player]! Think of air!"
    "I gasp for air."
    "This time I can breath properly."
    "I hyperventilate for a few moments to calm myself down from what just happened."
    "Where the hell did we end up?"
    "There's just nothing here."
    "Do I have to come up with the others as well?"
    "Or do they have to do it themselves?"
    "What if I think about the wrong things and they end up messed up somehow?"
    "They won't be the same person..."
    "Just my perception of them."
    "I have to think. There must be something I can do."
    "Maybe some place for us to be at would be a good start."

    "Okay...why is it all in black and white?"
    "Is this what this world is?"
    "Or was that because of me?"
    "I examine my hands and notice they're also just black and white."
    "At least it seems familiar."
    "Maybe this world is just another copy?"
    "Sayori wouldn't make it that easy, would she?"
    "Okay, I can do this."
    "I was alone before, I can regroup with them again."
    "How many times are we going to go through this to get to Sayori?"
    "We have to be getting closer."
    ay "We are getting closer."
    "Whoa! What the hell was that?"
    "It sounded like Ayame's voice."
    "But where is she...?"
    "Her voice sounds like it's coming from all directions."
    ay "Yes, hello. It's me."
    ay "I don't have a corporeal form here."
    ay "I guess it's just a side effect of this world."
