    "It's a very strange sensation."

    "Or was that portal a fake somehow?"
    "No...Ayame was so sure it wasn't."

    "Any...second..."
    "Maybe I have to do something."

    "But what can I even do?"
    "I don't have a body. It's like I'm just my consciousness."
    "Like a dream..."
    "But if this is like a dream, then I can make it whatever I want it to be...right?"
    "That's it, that's the key."
    "I try to imagine arms and hands."
    "I can sense the feeling of my hands returning."
    "But they feel...different, somehow."
    "They also lack...color?"
    "They're definitely my hands, they feel like they're not the same."
    "I'm getting sidetracked."
    "I need to get the rest of my body back."
    "One by one, my sense of feeling is coming back to me."
    "As my head comes back, I take a deep breath."
    "There's no air."
    "In my panic, I take another breath. There's still no air."
    "I'm suffocating! What do I do?!"
    "I was just fine before. Why is this happening now?!"
    "Think of air, [player]! Think of air!"
    "I gasp for air."
    "This time I can breath properly."
    "I hyperventilate for a few moments to calm myself down from what just happened."
    "Where the hell did we end up?"
    "There's just nothing here."
    "Do I have to come up with the others as well?"
    "Or do they have to do it themselves?"
    "What if I think about the wrong things and they end up messed up somehow?"
    "They won't be the same person..."
    "Just my perception of them."
    "I have to think. There must be something I can do."
